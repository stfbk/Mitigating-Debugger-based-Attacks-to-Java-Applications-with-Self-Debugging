# Mitigating Debugger-based Attacks to Java Applications with Self-Debugging

## Introduction

This repository collects complementary material for the article "Mitigating Debugger-based Attacks to Java Applications with Self-Debugging".

This repository contains the following folders:

* [**Java Debugger Protection**](./Java%20Debugger%20Protection): the anti-debugging protection for JDWP;
* [**oblive**](https://github.com/davidepi/oblive/tree/675bf8d918fee618632b5f7f58f178bbbb9db4e2): the anti-debugging protection for native-level debuggers in Unix-like operative systems;
* [**Debugging Tasks**](./Debugging%20Tasks): the list of debugging tasks;
* [**Experimentation Tool**](./Experimentation%20Tool): the experimental framework automating debugging tasks for the assessment of anti-debugging protections;
* [**Experimental Results**](./Experimental%20Results): the experimental results obtained by running the experimental framework on the Java and native debugger protections;
