# Mitigating Debugger-based Attacks to Java Applications with Self-Debugging | Experimental Results

## Introduction

This folder collects the experimental results obtained by running the experimental framework on the Java and native debugger protections.

This folder contains the following sub-folders:

* [**Native**](./Native): the results of the debugging tasks successfully executed when applying no protection against debugging, along with functional correctness;
* [**Back-end Damaging - Time Check**](./Back-end%20Damaging%20-%Time%20Check): the results of the debugging tasks successfully executed when applying the Back-end Damaging - Time Check pair of protections against debugging, along with functional correctness and execution times;
* [**Back-end Damaging - Self-Debugging**](./Back-end%20Damaging%20-%Self-Debugging): the results of the debugging tasks successfully executed when applying the Back-end Damaging - Self-Debugging pair of protections against debugging, along with functional correctness and execution times.
